#ROMAN CREDIT CARD VALIDATOR

##Whats going on

There are visitors in Vienna - Time Travellers from Roman Empire. They want to pay here with their credit cards and spend lot of their roman money.

An application has been written to check whether their cards are valid. We need to make sure it works as expected and there are no bugs.

###How does it work
Our guest enters his or her roman credit card number and will get back the info whether the card is valid or not.

**Roman credit cards** look similar to ours - they have 4 parts divided by a dash without blanks. E.g.
MMMMDCCXVI-MMCMXCI-MMMDCLXIV-MMMMMDXC would be our visa with number 4716 2991 3664 5590.

**Our credit card rules:**
- American Express uses 15-digit numbers.
- American Express numbers all start with 34 or 37.
- MasterCard uses 16-digit numbers.
- MasterCard numbers start with 51, 52, 53, 54, or 55.
- Visa uses 13- and 16-digit numbers.
- Visa numbers all start with 4.
- Every credit card number must be syntactically valid, according to the Luhnâ€™s algorithm.
